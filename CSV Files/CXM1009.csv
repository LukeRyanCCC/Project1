On the 14/05/2018 I came across a dead Germany Shepherd dog...dumped in the woods just off the road on Faulkners Lane Harbledown. Down the bank from the private farm track of Hospital Farm. I rang my Landlord Mr Finn and he attempted to call the police on serval occasions. I was about to leave for a week away. 
When I got back Mr Finn told me he had been unsuccessful in contact the police and had rung the council and they had kindly removed the poor old dog. Sh/e did look old. 
However, on one of my walks passing the same area I was struck by the awful smell of rotting animal and on the 23/05 I looked again and to my horror there was a badly decomposing dog.  
Along with this, earlier this month, both Mr and Mrs Finn and I had noticed parts of a lamb and in fact one of my dogs brought, to me, the foot of a lamb. Whether this is related or not is hard to say. 

Finding these dogs is terribly upsetting, being a dog/animal  lover. I am reluctant to do this but I did take a photo of the second dog, which I have uploaded. This dog is still there."

Also on returning to whitstable another area is being used for dumping rubbish - this was in the last parking area just before you take turn off for whitstable.  This is off the parking area in a gulley area which leads back onto the fields behind. 

These two areas need to be dealt with otherwise others will start to add to it.  Also some kind of deterent would probably help !!!
